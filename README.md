Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means it shares common characteristics with other OOP languages such as Java, C#, and PHP to name a few. 
But what makes a languages object-oriented?
<br>
<br>
There are 4 principles that apply to all object-oriented languages:
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

Before we dive into the object-oriented programming principles, it is important to understand what an object is.
an **object** is a combination of properties and methods. Think of it like a dog: a dog has a set of information (name, breed, color etc.) paired with a set of actions or behaviors(barking, tricks, fetch).
In programming, these sets of information and actions can be thought of as data and the functions/methods that come with the data. The dog itself would represent the object.

The first principle of object-oriented programming is **encapsulation**. In simple terms, encapsulation means that nothing outside of an object can directly access the data inside; it maintains a private state.
However, the private variables of an object can still be modified by public methods.
