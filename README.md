Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means it shares common characteristics with other OOP languages such as Java, C#, and PHP to name a few. 
But what makes a languages object-oriented?
<br>
<br>
There are 4 principles that apply to all object-oriented languages:
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

Before we dive into the object-oriented programming principles, it is important to understand what an object is.
an **object** is a combination of properties and methods. Think of it like a dog: a dog has a set of information (name, breed, color etc.) paired with a set of actions or behaviors(barking, tricks, fetch).
In programming, these sets of information and actions can be thought of as data and the functions/methods that come with the data. The dog itself would represent the object.
<br>
<br>
The first principle of object-oriented programming is **encapsulation**. In simple terms, encapsulation means that nothing outside of an object can directly access the data inside; it maintains a private state.
However, the private variables of an object can still be modified by public methods. 
<br>
<br>
The next object-oriented programming principle is **abstraction.** The idea of abstraction means that a person should only know the key elements of a program. For example, if someone has a code that takes 2 numbers and adds them together,
they would not need to know how the numbers are being added, only that the numbers will be added. Essentially, it's not caring about how a function works, only about what it does.
<br>
<br>
**Inheritance** is the third object-oriented programming principle. Inheritance allows one class to copy, or inherit, all the methods, variables, etc. from another class. Imagine many different types of cars, for instance.
While there are many types such as a Honda or a Lamborghini, they each derive a common set of properties from a base car class.
<br>
<br>
**Polymorphism** is the last of the object-oriented programming principles. Imagine telling a dog, a spider, and a human to walk. Each of these creatures have a different number of legs, and as a result, they walk in different ways.
Despite these differences, each creature can carry out the common task of walking, using different methods to do so. This is essentially polymorphism. Although each function would perform the same task, they have different ways of doing so.
